 *  Project: I'm a Big Kid Now (Avery Kim, Carmen Chan, Mehek Khandelwal)
 * @author Carmen Chan
 * @version May 16, 2019
 * Write a description of class ChildLinguisticAnalysis here.
 * 
 * We run this program by creating 3 objects. A Children object is created to 
 * compare the userâ€™s child (instance of the Child class). Therefore a Child 
 * object must also be created. Lastly, an Averages object is created to 
 * calculate the averages of both the Child and Children frequencies 
 * (how many of the 15 words we chose they can say). We call the 
 * computeChildAvg and computeChildrenAvg methods on the Averages object 
 * which takes both the Child and Children object in as parameters. 
 *
